When we’re reminded of something important, we’re far more likely to return and do it over and over.

***What is the fastest way to level up on Coin Master?***

This is one of the most confusing things about the game, and it is the reason I recommend watching the gameplay videos first and reading up on the basics to really understand what’s going on. The first thing you need to know is that the coins come in different types—red, yellow, and green. The color of the coin affects the amount of stars a level will produce. Red coins, for instance, are worth five stars, yellow coins are worth ten, and the rare green ones are worth twenty. You can see this in the screenshot above. There’s also a coin multiplier—it’s how many times the coins are multiplied. For example, if you have three coins and it’s a red one, you can get a total of 30. The higher the multipliers, the more coins you earn.

The main difference between the game modes is that in the Daily Challenge, you can only pick one difficulty per day, and there is no score at the end. The game can be played for free, and it doesn’t matter what level you’re on.

The other two modes are the Season Challenge and the Ranked Seasons. In the Season Challenge, you need to beat the player who’s ranked highest in the current season. If you’re having trouble, you can play on the Free Play mode. It’s the same as the Daily Challenge, but you can try it out without any limitations. Finally, there is the Ranked Seasons. This is the best way to get better and to level up.

You can choose from three different seasons—Weekly, Monthly, and Yearly. The Weekly and the Monthly are free, and the Yearly has a cost. The cost depends on the difficulty of the season. You can get a discount when you buy multiple months of the same season.

The main difference between the three seasons is that the Ranked Seasons will not show you what other players are doing in the game. The Daily Challenge is the only way to see the leaderboards.
